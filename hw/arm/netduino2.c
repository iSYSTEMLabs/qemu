     * - loader.c [line: 1070]  - rom_insert(rom);

     * Kernel is loaded into Rom objects, which are stored in loader.c. Only

     *   ...
     * }
     * are Roms copied to memory. However, since CPU reset is registered BEFORE
     * rom_reset(), SP and PC are read from memory BEFORE roms are copied to
     * memory. CPU reset also checks Roms for data, so this is normally not a
     * problem, but in STM32 PC and SP are read from aliased memory, and these
     * memory addresses are not mapped to Roms. Since ROMs are private in
     * loader.c the only option to copy Roms to memory is through reset. So we
     * first have to register Roms for reset, and then trigger system reset, which
     * copies Roms to mem, so that reset vectors are in memory, when
     * qemu_system_reset() is called again from main()
